# Biography
<blockquote>
My name is Daniel, and I am from Prosser, Washington. I began my studies at Eastern Washington University (EWU) in 2020, initially unsure of what to major in. However, I later discovered the Bachelor's program in Computer Science, which piqued my interest. In addition to my major, I have minors in Communications and Spanish, and I am currently pursuing a minor in Cybersecurity. I also work as an office aide at the Center for Academic Advising and Retention (CAAR) on the Cheney campus. Outside of academics, I have a passion for sneakers, sports, and cars.</blockquote>
