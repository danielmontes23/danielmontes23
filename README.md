# Biography
<blockquote>Hello, my name is Daniel, and I’m from Prosser, Washington. I began my academic journey at Eastern Washington University (EWU) in 2020, initially exploring different fields before discovering my passion for Computer Science. Since then, I’ve been pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, complemented by minors in Communications and Spanish. I’m also currently working toward a minor in Cybersecurity to further expand my technical knowledge and career options.</blockquote>

<blockquoteIn addition to my studies, I work as an office aide at the Center for Academic Advising and Retention (CAAR) on the Cheney campus, where I support student services and gain valuable professional experience. Outside the classroom, I’m an avid fan of sneakers, sports, and cars — interests that keep me inspired and connected to the world beyond academics.</blockquote>
